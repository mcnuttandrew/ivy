One alleged militant died in a strike that killed scores of children. It was the highest death toll in a strike recorded by the Bureau and it sparked outrage across Pakistan. The army blamed the CIA, having first said it was responsible for the attack. The change of tune was down to the level of collateral damage, a senior aide to General Musharraf said. The attack came on the day Islamabad was to sign a peace agreement with Bajaur Agency militants. The strike “sabotaged the chances for an agreement” according to a former ISI Director General.",

    "Description": "A strike outside Pakistan’s tribal area reportedly wounded Egyptian al Qaeda leader and ideologue Sheikh Issa al Masri. This was the first US drone strike outside the Federally Administered Tribal Agencies – an area of Pakistan with legal and political structures that differ from those in the rest of Pakistan. It was understood that any secret agreements between Washington and Islamabad that governed drone strikes only extended to the FATA, making this attack particularly sensitive.",
