# Ivy - an Integrated Visualization Editor

For local development install node deps and start development server as you normally would:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
# or if using npm
npm install
npm run start
```

Currently netlify runs the deployed version (and remounts automatically on push). It is hosted at https://kind-goldwasser-f3ce26.netlify.com/
